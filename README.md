# bored-in-math
What happens when I get bored in math class, and I have possession of a TI-84 graphing calculator.
Naturally, these are all written in TI-BASIC. There are some great tools for programming TI-BASIC without a calculator, but I've only found the official programs, available only for Mac and Windows.
