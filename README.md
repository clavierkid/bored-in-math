# bored-in-math
This is what happened when I got bored in math class, with a TI-84 calculator in my possession.
Naturally, these are all written in TI-BASIC. There are some great tools for programming TI-BASIC without a calculator, but I've only found the official programs, available only for Mac and Windows.
