Formulae- These programs contain various formulae. Install all of them to your calculator and run AFORM to start; after that, itâ€™s fairly self-explanatory.
Some of the programs might not have the same name they do in the master progarms (the lists), I did a bit of editing on the calculator after coding on the computer.
